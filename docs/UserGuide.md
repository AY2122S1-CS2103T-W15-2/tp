Dash is a personal planner app which offers unparalleled speed using text-based input. It supports both management of
tasks and contacts. Dash is tailored to the needs of university students, who must keep track of a slew of different 
deadlines and commitments. So long as you're a fast typist, Dash provides a blisteringly quick way to stay on top of 
your responsibilities using your keyboard.

This guide was written to help you set up and start using Dash. You can navigate by clicking the table of 
contents [below](#table-of-contents). If you're a new user, the Quick Start guide has all you need to get started. If 
you're an intermediate user looking to get more out of Dash, all supported commands are listed below.

## <u>Getting Started</u>

Dash supports contact and task management in several ways. 
In terms of contact management, Dash allows you to add contacts and fill in details such as their 
phone number, address, and email. 
It even allows you to group them using tags such as "Neighbour" or "Colleague", so you can look them up more easily. 
For task management, Dash allows you to add tasks, tag them, and set deadlines for them. 
Once you're done with a task, you can mark it as complete.

Dash uses a tab system to keep your contacts and tasks separate. 
To view and edit your contact list, you must switch to the contacts tab. 
Similarly, to view and edit your task list, you must switch to the tasks tab. 
Finally, the help tab provides you with a quick summary of Dash's features and how to use them.

![Switching Tabs](images/UG-01.png)

Dash uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) to optimize speed. This means that you use mostly your keyboard to interact 
with Dash, instead of relying on your mouse to click on options.    
   
   icons for notes abt cli here, talk about how you cant click on tabs here

![Using the CLI](images/CLITutorialGif.gif)

Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
Some example commands you can try:

* **`contacts`** : Switches to the contacts tab

* **`tasks`** : Switches to the tasks tab

* **`add n/Joe`** : Adds a contact named Joe.

* **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

* **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <u>Features</u>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `contacts`, `tasks` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
